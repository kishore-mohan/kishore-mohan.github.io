I am a developer with a huge passion for writing code (preferably open source and on my MacBook Pro).

On this blog, I would like to publish my experience with software development practices as well as more specific topics around my current languages (Ruby) and tools of choice. I’ve putting my hands on with quite a few different languages as well as frameworks in the past.


Every now and then I still write about those languages and frameworks as they relate to what I’m working on. In general though, I write about what I’m currently learning about or working with.


I live in Bangalore, India, When I am not programming, I enjoy being outdoors, riding bikes, treaking, net surfing, building things and spending time with my friends and family.
